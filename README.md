<img src="https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/min/angular-responsive-carousel" />

A simple solution for horizontal scrolling images with lazy loading.

Live demo can be found on [home page](http://ivylab.space/carousel).

üî¨Ô∏è Help make IvyCarousel better by [answering a few questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemPfIejDl3Pq4mFz32sFZgvLo7JbyXZPZFt4uDw9G4H92H8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Installation

Install the npm package.
```
  npm i angular-responsive-carousel
```
Import module:
```ts
  import {IvyCarouselModule} from 'angular-responsive-carousel';

  @NgModule({
      imports: [IvyCarouselModule]
  })
```

## Usage
Put the contents of your cells in containers with the `carousel-cell` class.

```html
<carousel>
    <div class="carousel-cell">
        <img src="path_to_image">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-cell">
        ...
</carousel>
```

Or prepare an image array for the carousel. If necessary, specify in the settings the sizes of the cells and the carousel container. And also select the method of arranging images inside the cells using the objectFit property.

```html
<carousel
    [images]="images">
</carousel>
```
```ts
images = [
    {path: 'PATH_TO_IMAGE'},
    ...
]
```

## Lazy loading
To use lazy loading, pass the carousel an array of images, as shown in the example above. Images will be uploaded only as needed, this will save you traffic. Using the `overflowCellsLimit` property, you can specify the number of images that will be loaded outside the visible area, which will allow the images to be loaded before they are displayed.
